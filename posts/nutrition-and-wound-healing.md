## Outline of regime
Very concise summary of what helps, and what doesn't in these docs:

 

* Get enough protein/carbs while healing. Pretty self-evident. Then

 

* Arginine in doses of least 30 g (I've found elsewhere 1g/kg) helps a LOT - but this is mostly intravenous, and more than ~6g per dose is not tolerated by the digestive system, and also needs to be diluted at 115 ml / g (so 6 g in ~ 700 ml water)
Needs to be taken on an empty stomach to be fully effective

* Glutamine helps, not directly, but as a general supportive measure as your body needs more of it during injury (found elsewhere that maximum tolerated well is 0.65g / kg bw, best dosage they tested was 0.75 but stopped increasing as it wasn't tolerated)

* HMB (betaHydroxybetaMethylButryate)  also helps, but mostly to preserve muscle rather than to aid healing

* Ornithine (amino acid) helps, and could probably be used to reduce arginine dosage (it's a metabolite of arginine, and is one of the 3 ways arginine helps healing, Other two are NO (direct) and IGF(stimulates release))

* Ornithine Ketoglutarate - good for supplying ornithine, but apparently has some other beneficial effects. No studies to support this that I've found, but many of the studies supporting ornithine used OKG

* Vit C  - up dose to multi-gram (no news here)

* Vit A, Iron, Zinc etc - only problem if deficient

 * Omega 3 - this document lists it as hindering, but later research shows that what this document saw as reduction in healing actually helps reduce scarring
