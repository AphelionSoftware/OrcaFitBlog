## Outline of regime
The assumption is that base nutrition (macro and micro), is already optimised, protein intake is above 1.6g / kg body weight, supplementation with vitamin D and all electrolytes and minerals are all already in place. Tools such as [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) for food tracking and [Nutrient Optimiser](https://nutrientoptimiser.com/) are useful for this and so this subject is out of scope for this article

The 5 most useful supplements for help with (muscoskeletal) injury are [Glutamine](https://examine.com/supplements/glutamine/),
[Arginine](https://examine.com/supplements/arginine/), [Citruline](https://examine.com/supplements/citrulline/), and [HMB](https://examine.com/supplements/hmb/),
[Fish Oil / Omega 3](https://examine.com/supplements/fish-oil/)

A brief summary of effects comes to:
* Arginine
  * Increase of growth hormone and IGF
  * Release of NOx
* Citrulline
  * Release of NOx (note that using citrulline and arginine together may be synergistic as they are proessed in the same pathway and converted between each other - no studies referenced here yet)
* HMB
  * Not in itself useful for injury recovery
  * Prevents loss of muscle mass
* Glutamine
  *
