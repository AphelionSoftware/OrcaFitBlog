## Outline of regime
The assumption is that base nutrition (macro and micro), is already optimised, protein intake is above 1.6g / kg body weight, supplementation with vitamin D, creatine and all electrolytes and minerals are all already in place. Tools such as [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) for food tracking and [Nutrient Optimiser](https://nutrientoptimiser.com/) are useful for this and so this subject is out of scope for this article

The 5 most useful supplements for help with (muscoskeletal) injury are [Glutamine](https://examine.com/supplements/glutamine/),
[Arginine](https://examine.com/supplements/arginine/), [Citruline](https://examine.com/supplements/citrulline/), and [HMB](https://examine.com/supplements/hmb/),
[Fish Oil / Omega 3](https://examine.com/supplements/fish-oil/)

A brief summary of effects comes to:
* Arginine
  * Increase of growth hormone and IGF (appears to be limited to IV and high single dose empty stomach intake)
  * Release of NOx
* Citrulline
  * Release of NOx (note that using citrulline and arginine together may be synergistic as they are proessed in the same pathway and converted between each other - no studies referenced here yet)
* HMB
  * Not in itself useful for injury recovery
  * Prevents loss of muscle mass
* Glutamine
  * Conditionally essential amino acid used extensively in wound repair
  * Increased requirements for glutamine pull it from the gut

## Example regimes
### Empiral example 1
While the individual pieces of dosage are derived from various studies, this combination hasn`t been studied, and instead is a personal use log.
Two of these ingredients taste pretty damn awful, so the fish oil was taken as [Nordic fish oil](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nordic-Oil-Strength-Flavoured-Tested/dp/B00M772GFG/ref=asc_df_B00M772GFG/?tag=bingshoppinga-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid={creative}&hvpos={adposition}&hvnetw=o&hvrand={random}&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl={devicemodel}&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=&hvtargid=pla-4584207578221607&psc=1) and the arginine can combined with [psyllium husk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Organic-Blond-Psyllium-Husk-500g/dp/B06XTHQM7S/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=2AQXOGLHOERBV&keywords=psyllium+husk+powder&qid=1556025469&s=drugstore&sprefix=psyl%2Cdrugstore%2C296&sr=1-2-spons&psc=1) (one tablespoon) to cut the taste.
In addition, the 6g dose of arginine may cause digestive distress, so it's often good to start with 2g (in the same amount of water) and increase to as high as you can tolerate
