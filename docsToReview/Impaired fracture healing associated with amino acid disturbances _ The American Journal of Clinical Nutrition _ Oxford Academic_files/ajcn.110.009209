Previous experimental studies have indicated the importance of sufficient nitric oxide production from arginine during normal fracture healing. However, during conditions of stress, such as inflammation, arginine availability can become limited, which may lead to a nonunion as a result of insufficient callus formation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1983564,"pct":53,"higher_than":2422271},"journal":{"count":4775,"mean":14.764807708421,"rank":3191,"pct":31,"higher_than":1494},"similar_age_3m":{"count":75531,"mean":4.5385307295114,"rank":26349,"pct":61,"higher_than":46660},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":36,"mean":5.2185714285714,"rank":19,"pct":41,"higher_than":15}},"type":"article","altmetric_id":707045,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_posts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":2,"cited_by_accounts_count":2,"last_updated":1334973140,"score":1.5,"history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.110.009209","added_on":1334955098,"published_on":1325376000,"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"readers":{"citeulike":"0","mendeley":"15","connotea":"0"},"readers_count":15,"images":{"small":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=2&types=tttttttt","medium":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=2&types=tttttttt","large":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=2&types=tttttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=707045"})
